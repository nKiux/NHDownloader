## !!The .exe file is compiled with [NuitkaGUI](https://github.com/271374667/NuitkaGUI), which might cause antivirus to detect, if you have any concern, don't use the .exe version, run Python file directly. !!

## Tutorial:
- install Python (if you use python version)
- pip install requests (if you use python version)
- Double click it to start
- input the six digit
- input the range you'd like to download (eg. 1-100, 18-80)

So... The python source code and Nuitka packed .exe files are above.

Since this is absolutely simple (And yes I used GitHub copilot and still wasted whole day solving the webp and jpg file problem since nhentai didn't care what format they use), you can change it whatever you like and 
# I'm not responsible for any problem and you should use it carefully.
